  title         = {Rigid comparison geometry for Riemannian bands and open incomplete manifolds},
  year          = {2022},
  abstract      = {Comparison theorems are foundational to our understanding of the geometric features implied by various curvature constraints. This paper considers manifolds with a positive lower bound on either scalar, 2-Ricci, or Ricci curvature, and contains a variety of theorems which provide sharp relationships between this bound and notions of {\em{width}}. Some inequalities leverage geometric quantities such as boundary mean curvature, while others involve topological conditions in the form of linking requirements or homological constraints. In several of these results open and incomplete manifolds are studied, one of which partially addresses a conjecture of Gromov in this setting. The majority of results are accompanied by rigidity statements which isolate various model geometries -- both complete and incomplete -- including a new characterization of round lens spaces, and other models that have not appeared elsewhere. As a byproduct, we additionally give new and quantitative proofs of several classical comparison statements such as Bonnet-Myers' and Frankel's Theorem, as well as a version of Llarull's Theorem and a notable fact concerning asymptotically flat manifolds. The results that we present vary significantly in character, however a common theme is present in that the lead role in each proof is played by \emph{spacetime harmonic functions}, which are solutions to a certain elliptic equation originally designed to study mass in mathematical general relativity.},

  abstract      = {We use the Dirac operator technique to establish sharp distance estimates for compact spin manifolds under lower bounds on the scalar curvature in the interior and on the mean curvature of the boundary. In the situations we consider, we thereby give refined answers to questions on metric inequalities recently proposed by Gromov. This includes optimal estimates for Riemannian bands and for the long neck problem. In the case of bands over manifolds of non-vanishing $\hat{\mathrm{A}}$-genus, we establish a rigidity result stating that any band attaining the predicted upper bound is isometric to a particular warped product over some spin manifold admitting a parallel spinor. Furthermore, we establish scalar- and mean curvature extremality results for certain log-concave warped products. The latter includes annuli in all simply-connected space forms. On a technical level, our proofs are based on new spectral estimates for the Dirac operator augmented by a Lipschitz potential together with local boundary conditions.},

  abstract      = {We prove the following Lipschitz rigidity result in scalar curvature geometry. Let $M$ be a closed smooth connected spin manifold of even dimension $n$, let $g$ be a Riemannian metric of regularity $W^{1,p}$, $p > n$, on $M$ whose distributional scalar curvature in the sense of Lee-LeFloch is bounded below by $n(n-1)$, and let $f \colon (M,g) \to \mathbb{S}^n$ be a $1$-Lipschitz continuous (not necessarily smooth) map of non-zero degree to the unit $n$-sphere. Then $f$ is a metric isometry. This generalizes a result of Llarull (1998) and answers in the affirmative a question of Gromov (2019) in his "four lectures". Our proof is based on spectral properties of Dirac operators for low regularity Riemannian metrics and twisted with Lipschitz bundles. We argue that the existence of a non-zero harmonic spinor field forces $f$ to be quasiregular in the sense of Reshetnyak, and in this way connect the powerful theory for quasiregular maps to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.},

  abstract  = {To achieve high retrieval accuracy over a large scale image/video dataset, recent research efforts have demonstrated that employing extremely high-dimensional descriptors such as the Fisher Vector (FV) and the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) can yield good performance. To enable fast search, the FV (or VLAD) is usually compressed by product quantization (PQ) or hashing. However, compressing high-dimensional descriptors via PQ or hashing may become intractable and infeasible due to both the storage and computation requirements for the linear/nonlinear projection of PQ or hashing methods. We develop a novel compact aggregated descriptor via dual selection for visual search. We utilize both sample-specific Gaussian component redundancy and bit dependency within a binary aggregated descriptor to produce its compact binary codes. The proposed method can effectively reduce the codesize of the raw aggregated descriptors, without degrading the search accuracy or introducing additional memory footprint. We demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed binary codes in solving the approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) visual search problem. Experimental results on extensive datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Our proof is independent from the injectivity of the Baum-Connes assembly map for the fundamental group of M and relies on the construction of a certain infinite dimensional flat vector bundle out of a sequence of finite dimensional vector bundles on M whose curvatures tend to zero. Besides the well known fact that M does not carry a metric with positive scalar curvature, our results imply that the classifying map $M \to B \pi_1(M)$ sends the fundamental class of M to a nontrivial homology class in $H_n(B \pi_1(M) ; \Q)$. This answers a question of Burghelea (1983).},
