My main research interests lie in scalar curvature comparison geometry, spin geometry, Dirac operators and index theory. Currently, I am working on extremality and rigidity statements with lower scalar curvature bounds in combination with higher index theory. Thereby, I am using twisted Dirac operators linear over a <nobr>C*-algebras</nobr> and combine analytical methods with spinorial techniques.
